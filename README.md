# Codewars Solutions

Welcome to my repository of Codewars solutions! Iâ€™ve organized the tasks based on the year I completed them, showing the progression of my coding journey and improvements over time.

> [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is an online platform for learning and practicing coding through challenges of varying difficulty levels and programming languages.

## Structure
- [2021](./2021) - Early solutions from when I started learning Python on Codewars.
- [2022](./2022) - One SQL exercise. ðŸ˜ƒ I was motivated for one day, but I just had too much work.
- [2024](./2024) - While studying at 42 Vienna, I got motivated to start learning Python again.
